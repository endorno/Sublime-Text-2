perltidy for Sublime Text 2
===========================
Thank you for installing SublimePerlTidy! Below are some quick notes to get
you started with the plugin. Please refer to:

    https://github.com/vifo/SublimePerlTidy

for the full documentation.

Quick start
-----------
To reformat Perl source code with SublimePerlTidy, open your Perl file of
choice and hit Ctrl+Shift+t on Windows/Linux and Super+Shift+t on OSX.

SublimePerlTidy will try to find your perltidy installation by looking at your
PATH settings and searching for perltidy in default installation locations.

Should this automatic detection fail, please inspect any error output on the
Sublime Text 2 console and adjust user setting "perltidy_cmd" as described in
the full documentation.

Thank You.
